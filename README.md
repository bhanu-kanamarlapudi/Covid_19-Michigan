# covid19_MI

For this project, I've used a variety of datasets to predict the number of Covid-19 cases for various counties in the state of Michigan.
The datasets include
 - counties.csv, which contains the list of counties in Michigan, along with locations of their nearby weather stations.
 - michigan.csv, which contains the daily covid-19 cases reported for each county in Michigan, downloaded from https://www.michigan.gov/documents/coronavirus/Cases_and_Deaths_by_County_and_by_Date_of_Symptom_Onset_or_by_Date_of_Death2021-10-20_738873_7.xlsx
 - mobility.csv, which contains Apple mobility trends report downloaded from https://covid19.apple.com/mobility.
 - weather.csv. which contains daily weather data downloaded from https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search?datasetid=GHCND
